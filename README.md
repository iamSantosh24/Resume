Resume Android project

Required tool versions
- Gradle (wrapper): 8.10.2 (set in gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties)
- Android Gradle Plugin (AGP): 8.8.0 (declared in gradle/libs.versions.toml)
- Kotlin plugin: 1.9.24 (declared in gradle/libs.versions.toml)

Build notes
- Use the project wrapper to build: `./gradlew build`
- If you upgrade AGP or Kotlin, also update the Gradle wrapper to the minimum supported Gradle version required by the AGP change.

If you want me to try safe version bumps (Kotlin/AGP) and run compatibility checks, tell me which upgrade direction you'd like (minor/patch), and I'll run a build + tests to validate.
